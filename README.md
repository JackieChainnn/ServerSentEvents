# ServerSentEvents
With server-sent events, it's possible for a server to send new data to a web page at any time, by pushing messages to the web page. 

I use exios instead of fetch api or XMLHttpRequest for making a request and fetching a resource from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) fake API.
